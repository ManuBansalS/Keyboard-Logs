# ⌨️📝  Keyboard Logs

A simple interactive web application that logs and displays keyboard events in real-time. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this tool captures the key pressed, its corresponding keyCode, and the physical key code, then dynamically renders this data in a responsive table format.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time key press detection
- Logs `key`, `keyCode`, and `code` values
- Clean and responsive design
- Automatically updates the table with each new key press

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Press any key while on the webpage.

3. A table is rendered with details of each key press:
   - **Key**: Character or function of the key pressed.
   - **KeyCode**: Numerical code representing the key.
   - **Code**: Physical key on the keyboard.

2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Press any key and watch the magic happen!
